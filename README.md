# Ben Bentley

MS in Data Science @ University of Chicago with 3+ years of analytics experience supporting CPG clients using transaction-level data. I’m focused on building practical machine learning models—especially tabular predictive modeling and applied ML—bridging rigorous evaluation with business decision-making.

**Core skills:** Python • SQL • scikit-learn • PyTorch • pandas • model evaluation/ML pipelines • Tableau/Power BI
